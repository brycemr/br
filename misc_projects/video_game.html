											<h2>Puzzle Video Game</h2>
									</header>

									<h3 class="major">Objective</h3>
									<p>As a personal project, I wanted to build a first-person puzzle video game
									prototype in which the rooms of the building rearrange themselves as the player moves
									throughout the game. I also wanted the player to be able to collect and interact with
									items and puzzles. With more time I want to develop a full-length game, which will need
									to be able to incorporate data storage that saves the state of the game when the player
									exits and reloads this data when the player starts the game up again.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Technical Details</h3>
									<p>I used the Unity game engine to develop this game and used C#
										 scripts to control the different aspects of the game. To store
										 player data, I used JSON in a text file that I would read from
										at game startup and write to when the player terminates the game.
										I used another JSON file to specify the different locations and
										arrangements that the rooms could take when moved around during
										the game. The models I used for this game were downloaded from
										the Unity Asset store or created using simple elements
										available in the Unity Editor. The game also allows for
										player control using a mouse and keyboard or using a
										Playstation 4 controller. To achieve this functionality
										I had to create code that would work based on mapped inputs,
										rather than directly watching for specific buttons or keys from
										the user. One large challenge in this project was moving the rooms
										around while maintaining all of their contents even as the player
										moved items between rooms. I addressed this issue by assigning a
										room as a parent for each game object and then moving these game objects to
										maintain their same relative position in the room anytime the room
										changed position and or orientation. The parent room for objects changes
										as the objects pass through invisible triggers placed in doorways.
										The triggers cause a script to reassign the parent room to match the
										current room, so when the rooms shift all the objects inside shift with it.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Results</h3>
									<p>I was able to create a first-person puzzle video game prototype.
										The rooms rearranged themselves as desired while the game progressed,
										becoming a part of the overall puzzle of the game. I have also been able
										 to implement a pause screen, a settings menu, and save files. I plan to
										 continue developing this game in the future and eventually publish it to
										 a video game digital distribution service.

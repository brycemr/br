									<h3 class="major">Objective</h3>
									<p>For this project, I wanted to build a tool to help simplify the process of selecting
									meals to cook for a week by automating the ordering of necessary ingredients for a
									given recipe. I want to be able to select a recipe in the tool, and all the ingredients
									needed for that recipe would then be added to my cart on Walmart.com, where I could
									then have them delivered to my home.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Technical Details</h3>
									<p>I decided to build this project as a chrome extension using Javascript. To store a
									user’s recipes and their associated ingredients I used the database that is accessible
									locally in chrome browsers. One of the most difficult aspects of this project was
									navigating Walmart.com using the chrome extension in order to search for ingredients
									and add ingredients to my cart. I opened new tabs using functions built into Chromium
									and then used Chromium to inject scripts into these web pages. These scripts use
									Jquery and standard Javascript to navigate the DOM of the webpage. This allowed my
									automation to identify and interact with the necessary parts of Walmart.com in order to
									add items to my cart. After starting this project I also decided that it would be nice to be
									able to import recipes from allrecipes.com to my automation tool. I followed a similar
									process as before to extract the ingredients from a recipe on allrecipes.com and import
									them into the database of my chrome extension housing all the user’s recipes. The
									different views of my chrome extension are handled by updating the HTML of my
									chrome extension, inserting the HTML for the current view, and displaying the buttons
									that should be currently active. The grocery queue view and recipe book view are
									dynamically created by adding HTML elements for each recipe.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Results</h3>
									<p>I was successful in creating a chrome extension that is able to import the
									ingredients required for a recipe found on allrecipes.com. It is also able to add the
									necessary ingredients for any number of specified recipes to a cart on Walmart.com. I
									have not published this chrome extension to the Chrome store as there are still stylistic
									changes that I would like to make to its layout and other small features I would like to
									add to the UI to make it easier to use for someone who doesn’t have my background
									knowledge on how the tool works. In the future, I would also like to use React.js to
									handle different views in my chrome extension, in order to simplify my code and make
									maintenance easier. The current code for this project can be found on my Github.

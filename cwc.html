									<h2>Collegiate Wind Competition</h2>
									</header>

									<h3 class="major">Objective</h3>
									<p>I worked alongside a team of 13 students to design a wind turbine to
									compete in the Collegiate Wind Competition hosted by the Department of Energy. I
									worked with a subteam of four students to design and create the control system for our
									turbine as well as a resistor relay to act as a dynamic load. The control system needed to be able to adjust the pitch of the turbine blades, slow
									the turbine to 10% of its maximum speed under emergency stop conditions, detect a load disconnect, and adjust a resistor load connected to the generator.
									By meeting all of these objectives we were able to regulate the power output of our turbine’s
									generator and score well in the practice competitions we ran.

									<h3 class="major">Technical Details</h3>
									<p>We used an encoder to measure the RPM of our turbine, and used this in conjunction with a voltage divider to guide our controls. 
										The data acquired was passed to an Arduino microcontroller and
									used to regulate and update the states guiding the control of the turbine and load side
									components. To regulate the power curve of the turbine, we designed a variable load that
									incorporates a resistor array to maximize power generation at wind speeds from 5-11
									m/s. A variable pitch system was used to ensure steady power from 11 m/s to 14 m/s and was
									controlled by a linear actuator connected to out Arduino.

									<h3 class="major">Results</h3>
									<p>
										Our turbine's control system met all of the objectives we had for it during several test runs we conducted at the competition. We 
										were able to successfully control the power output of the turbine and enter a shut down state when the load was disconnected from the power.
										Unfortunately, during official testing there was a mechanical failure in a linkage arm, resulting in our generating decoupling from the main shaft.
										This resulted in no power being generated for the rest of the test, so we were unable to determine the final score our controls system would have obtained.
										However, even with this failure we were still able to place 7th in turbine testing out of 13 teams. Overall, I am satisfied with the improvements that we were 
										able to make on last year's design, which had no controls system, and think that we are leaving next year's team a good starting point to build off of.

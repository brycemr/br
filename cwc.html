									<h3 class="major">Objective</h3>
									<p>I am currently working with a team of 13 students to design a wind turbine to
									compete in the Collegiate Wind Competition hosted by the Department of Energy. I am
									working with a subteam of four students to design and create the control system for our
									turbine. The control system must be able to adjust the pitch of the turbine blades, slow
									the turbine to 10% of its maximum speed under emergency stop conditions, detect the
									ambient wind temperature, and adjust a resistor load connected to the generator.
									Meeting all of these objectives will allow us to regulate the power output of our turbine’s
									generator and score well in the upcoming competition.

									<h3 class="major">Technical Details</h3>
									<p>We use an encoder to measure the RPM of our turbine, a pitot tube connected to
									a pressure sensor to monitor wind speed, and a voltage divider to monitor power output
									and load connection. The data acquired is passed to an Arduino microcontroller and
									used to regulate and update the states guiding the control of the turbine and load side
									components. To regulate the power curve, we designed a variable load that
									incorporates a resistor array to maximize power generation at wind speeds from 5-11
									m/s. A variable pitch system will ensure steady power from 11 m/s to 14 m/s and will be
									controlled by a linear actuator connected to an Arduino. We have already built the pitch
									system and are currently prototyping the variable load design and testing the logic and
									functionality of our state machine.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Results</h3>
									<p>At the beginning of each month, we conduct a mock competition to check the
									current state of our turbine and estimate the score we would receive in the real
									competition. We have access to our university’s team results from the previous year, as
									well as the scores received by the other universities that attended the competition last
									year. We use these scores as benchmarks to help gauge the success of our turbine
									prototype. Our current prototype has already improved upon the score our university’s
									team received last year, and is able to achieve a coefficient of power near that of the
									team that won the competition last year. In wind speeds of 11 m/s, our turbine is able to
									produce 19.8 W of power with a coefficient of power of 0.152.

									<h3 class="major">Objective</h3>
									<p>As part of a Neuromechanics of Movement course, I wanted to explore how
									human infants learn to roll over by training a reinforcement learning agent. This required
									creating a simple model of a human infant for the reinforcement learning agent to
									control and specifying the possible actions of the agents so they could learn to roll over.

									<h3 class="major">Technical Details</h3>
									<p>I created the model for the infant, and trained the reinforcement learning agent, in
									the Unity game engine. This allowed me to use the Unity Machine Learning Agents Toolkit
									(ML-Agents) package which uses Python to run a deep reinforcement learning algorithm
									that uses Unity as the learning environment. For the agent to learn, it needs to take action,
									make observations about the environment, and receive a reward or punishment based on
									its state. My agent was given four continuous actions to choose from for its limbs and chose
									the corresponding amount of torque to apply for these actions. The agent was also given
									two discrete actions to determine the axis of rotation for the arms. After each step, the agent
									would make eight observations to determine the rotation of its limbs, torso, and the vertical
									position of a marker on its chest. These observations were pertaining to the rotation of its
									limbs, torso, and the position of the marker. If the agent rolled over completely, and the
									marker touched the floor, it would be given a large reward in addition to the time remaining
									on a 30-second timer. If the timer terminated before the agent was able to roll over, it would
									receive a score determined by the position of the marker, with the reward increasing as the
									marker approached the floor. These actions, observations, and rewards were handled by
									C# scripts that I developed. The scripts turned the actions selected by the agent into limb
									torques, and then returned the observations and reward values back to the agent.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Results</h3>
									<p>The reinforcement learning agent that I trained met my primary goal and was
									successful in learning to roll over. It also exhibited a rolling pattern similar to those seen in
									human infants, as it synchronously used its limbs to rotate its torso. However, the learning
									of this agent was not as stable as I would have hoped. I believe this was in part due to the
									limb control that the agent had access to in the C# scripts I developed. The limb control was
									difficult for a human to learn and in future development, I would like to modify the control to
									make the same actions result in more consistent movements across different arm postures.
									I would also want to attempt to address the issues with stability by experimenting with
									changes to the configuration of the reinforcement learning algorithm, as well as changes to
									the actions and observations that the agent makes.

									<h3 class="major">Objective</h3>
									<p>As a personal project, I wanted to build a first-person puzzle video game
									prototype in which the rooms of the building rearrange themselves as the player moves
									throughout the game. I also wanted the player to be able to collect and interact with
									items and puzzles. With more time I want to develop a full-length game, which will need
									to be able to incorporate data storage that saves the state of the game when the player
									exits and reloads this data when the player starts the game up again.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Technical Details</h3>
									<p>I programmed this optimizer in Julia, using the FLOWFarm and SNOW libraries
									from Brigham Young University’s FLOW Lab. These libraries have built-in functions for
									performing sparse non-linear optimizations and calculating important properties related
									to wind farms, such as wake interference between turbines and annual energy
									production. These libraries do not currently have methods for dynamically calculating
									the foundation costs for the turbines in an offshore wind farm, so I created functions to
									generate different depth patterns and calculate the cost of a turbine’s monopile
									foundation given a specified depth, wind speed, turbine dimensions, and yield stress. To
									estimate the cost of the monopile, the program calculates the diameter and thickness of
									the monopile based on the yield stress of steel and the largest bending moment caused
									by the wind load on the turbine, factoring in the length of the beam required for a given
									depth. The beam's diameter, thickness, and length can then be used to find the beam's
									mass, which can then be converted into a cost and used in the optimization of the
									LCOE. The optimization is performed using a gradient-based descent and automatic
									differentiation to find the most favorable action for the optimizer to take in each iteration.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Results</h3>
									<p>The functions that I created to calculate the Levelized Cost of Energy for an
									offshore wind farm, taking into account the monopile foundation costs under varying
									conditions, were validated as my model returned values within 3% of those found in a
									paper published by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory that I based my
									monopile modeling approach on. The 3% variance can be accounted for by slight
									differences in their assumptions for the cost of the tower and wind data compared to the
									values assumed in my model. My optimizer was also successful in the main objective of
									decreasing the LCOE. For the initial test state with a constant depth of 23.5m, the
									optimizer improved the LCOE of the wind farm by 8.45%. When running tests with
									several depth patterns varying from 10 to 60m, the optimizer improved the LCOE by
									8.99% on average. The Julia code I developed can be found on my Github.
